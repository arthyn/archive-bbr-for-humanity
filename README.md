# BBR for Humanity

This was an old project I did after my first four months as a web developer in 2014. We wanted to create a *Cards Against Humanity* inspired theme where we could list nice things you could do for people during the holidays. It was my first project that used a significant amount of JS, and I'm proud of how it turned out.
